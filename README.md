MixQuest
========

MixQuest is a game-like demo and, alas, is not an actual playable game (yet).

## Demo

The project gives a real-world example for the following:

* [DynaMix](https://github.com/iboB/dynamix) - A dynamic type composition, OOP, and polymorphism library.
* [yama](https://github.com/iboB/yama) - A game math library.

## Setup instructions

There are submodules in this repo. Don't forget to call `git clone --recursive` or after cloning `git submodule update --init --recursive`

*...more to come*
